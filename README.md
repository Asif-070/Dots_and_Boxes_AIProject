# ðŸŽ® Dots and Boxes

An AI course project for game **dots and boxes** using *Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning* & *Genetic algorithm* for AI and basic *Fuzzy logic* for showing how well the player did against the AI.

## ðŸ§  AI Techniques Implemented

**Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**  
   - Looks ahead a certain depth.  
   - Uses pruning to avoid exploring unnecessary branches.  
   - Strives to optimize the score under the assumption that the opponent plays optimally. 

**Genetic Algorithm**  
   - Maintains a population of strategies.  
   - Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better play over generations.

**Fuzzy Logic Evaluation**  
  - After each game, compare player vs AI performance.  
  - Outputs feedback based on fuzzy criteria.
